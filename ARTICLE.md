# Lessons Learned in Software Development

I read [this article](https://henrikwarne.com/2015/04/16/lessons-learned-in-software-development/) to grasp a great overview to Software Engineering.

As a beginner to Software Engineering, I thought that it might be helpful to read an article that explains "dos and don'ts." After reading the article, I became more certain about the nature of SWE, understanding that consistent testing and communication are important and how to execute those important disciplines. Furthermore, I realized that the upcoming projects will be larger than what I have ever made, so I would constantly remind myself of the suggestions provided in the article to effectively develop software.
